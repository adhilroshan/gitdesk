# GitDesk

**Code Integrity, Reimagined.**

GitDesk is the AI-native security partner for modern developers. It replaces fragmented toolchains with a single, high-performance native platform designed to catch vulnerabilities, secrets, and bugs *before* you push.

## 🛡️ Core Features

### 1. AI Security Agent
Proactive vulnerability scanning that runs locally. Catch API keys, tokens, and insecure code patterns before they ever reach your remote repository.
- **Secret Detection**: Instant alerts for leaked credentials.
- **Local-First**: Your code never leaves your machine for analysis.
- **Auto-Fix**: AI-suggested patches for common security flaws.

### 2. Native Worktrees
Stop stashing and context-switching. GitDesk treats Git Worktrees as first-class citizens, allowing you to manage multiple branches simultaneously in parallel directories with zero friction.

### 3. Agentic Workflows
Orchestrate a swarm of specialized AI agents to solve complex refactoring tasks autonomously under your supervision.
- **Security Agent**: Hardens your code.
- **Performance Agent**: Identifies bottlenecks and Big-O complexity.
- **Maintainability Agent**: Enforces clean code and type safety.

### 4. Smart Git Graph
A custom-built, high-performance graph engine that renders complex repository histories with extreme clarity. Understand merges, rebases, and branch structures at a glance.


## 🚀 Vision

GitDesk aims to revolutionize the development lifecycle by moving security and quality checks from the "Pull Request" stage to the "Write" stage. By providing immediate feedback through an agentic interface, we enable developers to ship secure, high-quality code with higher velocity.
